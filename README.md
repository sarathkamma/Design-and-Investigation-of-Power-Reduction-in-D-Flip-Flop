# Design-and-Investigation-of-Power-Reduction-in-D-Flip-Flop
Description: 
1. This study focuses on the design and analysis of a low-power D-flip-flop. The key innovation is the use of a Topological Compression Technique to reduce power consumption. By merging logically equivalent transistors, the number of clock-related transistors is minimized to three, significantly lowering power usage. The proposed Topologically Compressed Flip-Flop (TCFF) achieves up to 75% power savings compared to traditional designs, especially under low data activity conditions. The design is simulated using the Microwind tool, confirming its power efficiency.

Methodology:
Analysis of Existing Flip-Flops: Different existing low-power flip-flops were analyzed to understand their limitations, such as increased transistor count or power inefficiency.
Topological Compression: The methodology involves merging logically equivalent AND/OR logic gates at the transistor level, reducing clock-related transistors.
Design of TCFF: The TCFF design includes only three transistors connected to the clock signal, which minimizes power consumption.
Simulation: The performance of the TCFF was compared to other flip-flops, using simulations to measure power reduction across various data activitiesâ€‹
